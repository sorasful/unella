## üíº Installation & Usage  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sorasful/unella.git

cd unella
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use the Unella Command-Line Interface (CLI) to start your audit:

```bash
# json output to stdout 
unella --path /path_to_python_project/ --output-format json

# generate a HTML report 
unella --path /path_to_python_project/ --output-format html
```

Replace path_to_python_project with the path to your Python project.
For an HTML report, replace json with html.
